# Digital Lab Simulation

In Electronics/ computer/ IT/ Engineering academic curriculum there is subject-Digital Logic design which feels very difficult for students as they can not get the concepts clear of how digital circuits work actually and hence they lack confidence in practicals.

My this project will definitely help students just by installing Java jdk latest version on their computer and simply double click on `simulation.jar` file in project directory.

Various tabs are provided on GUI dashboard for multiple  logic circuits.
click on topic which you want study and try giving inputs in 0s and 1s and accordingly check the simulated output of that circuit. Happy Learning.



## Project Demo
